//This section controls how much ammo to give to various different classifications of weapons.
//So if you only want a few mags for pistols, you can define it here.
//This is the total ammo count, as weapons of the same class can have varying mag sizes I feel it best to allow the user to define exactly
//how much so they can tweak it to their personal taste.
//NOTE: Max Ammo Capacity is controlled through your shooting skill, no matter the value set here it will not go above your max capacity.
