//This section controls how much ammo to give to various different classifications of weapons
//So if you only want a few mags for pistols, you can define it here.
//This is the total ammo count, as weapons of the same class can have varying mag sizes I feel it best to allow the user to define exactly how much so they can tweak it to their personal taste.
//NOTE: Max ammo capacity is something that's controlled through your game, so no matter what the value is set in here if your max capacity is lower it'll go to that amount (Ammo Cap. is decided through Shooting skill)
