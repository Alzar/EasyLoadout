# LoadoutPlus by Alzar
LSPDFR Plugin that adds the ability to load a certain loadout when you go on duty aswell as having a button to re-give it to you at any time.

All of my GTA 5 mods are open source and if you're a programmer that's wanting to either update an old mod that I've stopped updating or put your own spin on it feel free to use my code! I just ask that you simply give me some sort of credit somewhere on your release page!
